# React++

## Overview
React++ is a modern full-stack web framework that seamlessly integrates frontend and backend development workflows. By combining React (powered by Vite) on the frontend with PHP on the backend, React++ enables developers to centralize application logic in a single codebase.

## Features
- **Unified Development**: Write PHP and React code in the same file
- **Modern Tooling**: Leverages Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Simplified Architecture**: Centralizes business logic for easier maintenance

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- PHP 7.4 or higher
- Node.js and npm
- Python 3.x

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shrehanrajsingh/reactplusplus.git
    cd reactplusplus
    ```

2. Run the development server:
    ```bash
    python3 path_to_php_file_with_react_code
    ```

3. Access the application at `http://localhost:5173`

## Usage
React++ supports any file that incorporates both PHP and React code in one place. A sample implementation is available at `tests/test.jsx` to help you get started.
